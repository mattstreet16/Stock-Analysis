# stock-analysis
##### Using vba to analyze stocks

## Overview of Project
I was tasked with helping a friend who was analyzing the growth of green stocks so he and his family could invest for their future. My friend provided me with an excel file fully of green energy stocks for me to analyze. Using my VBA skills I managed to write a handful of macros to help my friend automate the stock analysis process. After getting the results my friend chellenges me to refactor my code to better automate the process and compare my results. 
## Results
Firstly we examined the stock outputs based on 2017 and 2018 and how long it took my comupter to run the Macros script.

After refactoring my code the results of the analysis changed drastically.

## Summary
In summation it is evident that refactoring my original code changed the outcome. This is because in the refactored code I used arrays to track the tickers I set which allowed the code to run once rather than go over again and again multiple times for all stocks.
